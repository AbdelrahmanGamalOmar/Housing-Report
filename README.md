# Housing-Report
Nashivlle Housing Report (2013-2019) in SQL - PowerBi

This project presents an analysis of housing data from Nashville, focusing on various aspects such as property details, sale dates, owner addresses, and more. The analysis aims to provide insights into the Nashville housing market through SQL queries and DAX applied to a dataset containing relevant information.

I would like to acknowledge and express my gratitude to Alex The Analyist for their invaluable guidance and instruction in SQL.
The SQL code in this project is based on the concepts and techniques taught in his video.
Their expertise and clear explanations greatly contributed to my understanding and proficiency in SQL.

It's important to note that the Power BI portion of this project was solely developed by me, building upon the SQL foundation provided by the instructor.
